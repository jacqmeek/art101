      <h2>CHALLENGES</h2>
      <p>We hardly had any scheduling challenges this week as we were able to work in person and via Discord to complete all of our work. We only had minor issues with Atom that worked itself out.</p><br>

    <div id="problems">
      <h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
      <p>We had a problem with our button refusing to work once clicked. Jacquelyn's console kept saying there was an error defining a certain line in the JS file although it was defined. Alex's console also said there was an error but it would identify a line that had no issues. We deemed these as a temporary glitches because the error codes disappeared and the button started working a couple hours later.</p><br>
