      <h2>CHALLENGES</h2>
      <p>The biggest challenge that we had to face for this lab is balancing the work load between the working team prototype assignment and this lab. In most cases, there were very few labs that needed debugging, but each of us eventually found one that could be worked on.</p>

      <h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
      <p>When it comes to the code, we did not face any problems during this lab. Since time has passed and we built upon our early expertise of programming we were more comfortable revisiting some of the older labs.</p>

      <h2>DEBUGGING</h2>
      <p> I have struggled in understanding and applying new knowledge in each language over the past few weeks. Now, I can say I am pretty confident in HTML. CSS continues to stump me every once-in-a-while, but I eventually figure out each action. JavaScript is still very new and confusing to me, so I am constantly using W3Schools and lecture notes to make functions and various actions. jQuery has made things a bit easier, but I am struggling to remember everything.

      Debugging/fixing Lab 6 was a bit of a challenge because I thought it was strickly my CSS not working properly. Once I read and compared the HTML and CSS, I realized there were some naming issues that I hadn't noticed before. Thankfully every fix I've needed to work out has not raised an error, but they have taken some time.</p>
