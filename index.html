			<p>Hey there! My name is Jacquelyn Meek. I am a 3rd-year transfer Art major, soon-to-be double-minoring in CS and FDM. My main artistic focus is in digital arts such as photography and graphic design. In my spare time, I like going to concerts, traveling, and (as of recently) hiking through the woods. This site will show you a detailed description of process learning various coding languages and operations. Click on the links below to check out each lab!</p>
